## Overview

The compiler that:
- generates a Yul (https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html) code from an OCaml code,
- passes the compiled result to `solc`, and 
- saves the result `.json` file including an ABI and an EVM code.

## How to Build

At First, do `dune build` (this only needs to be done at the first build).
By `dune exec ocamyulc <parent>/<dirname>/<filename>.ml`, 
`.json` file for `<filename>.ml` is generated and saved in `<parent>/contracts` directory.

Before compiling, you need to install `solc`, not `solcjs`. 
For installation, refer to https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#linux-packages.
